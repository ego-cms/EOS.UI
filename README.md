Introduction
-----------
**EGO Introduces EOS.UI: iOS and Android App-ready Themes and Templates for developers**
*EOS.UI offers ready-to-use mobile app themes and templates for developers, start-ups and digital agencies*

EGO announced the creation of EOS.UI - a store of ready-made application templates for iOS and Android devices. Templates are a set of executable control codes, components, designed pages, design guides and documentation, graphical assets, PSD, Marvel or Sketch source code.

EGO launches EOS.UI in the in the constant additions and updates - firstly separate controls and components will be available, then complete templates for different application categories will be added.

EOS.UI controls and components combine high-quality professional design, thought-out UX, quality testing and timely support. This allows developers (EOS.UI users) to increase the speed of application development, to offer their customers a new level of application performance and significantly reduce the development cost:

* The process of creating a global UI application is simplified due to the unified theme management system - the developer does not need to set the parameters of the components individually throughout the code, they are easily installed in global settings and applied to all EOS elements.
* Created a single API for iOS and Android - provides clear work of components and control interfaces, herewith it still has access to the native API. In addition, some platform-specific parameters have been redesigned for more obvious and convenient use.
* Developed a system of individual styles that allows you to override the theme settings of a particular component or control without violating the API unification principle.

iOS and Android Sample Apps
-----------
We've created Sandbox Apps for both iOS and Android where you can play with controls and components, with their styles, fonts, sizes, etc. 

There we've implemented 2 Themes support: light and dark ones. You can switch between themes and or play with every single control / component and customize them as you'd prefer. We hope that common sense prevail and you won't create a black button with black text on it :wink:
